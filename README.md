Welcome to the official monorepo for the **Nova UI Kit**, the comprehensive design system and component library for the TUWA ecosystem. This project provides all the necessary tools to build beautiful, consistent, and high-performance Web3 applications.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Philosophy

Our ecosystem is built on a clear separation of concerns:

-   **Pulsar Engine (`pulsar-core`, `pulsar-evm`):** The headless state management libraries that handle all the Web3 logic.
-   **Nova UI Kit (this repo):** The view layer, providing foundational styles and React components to visualize the state managed by Pulsar.

## üì¶ Packages in this Monorepo

This repository is managed using `pnpm` workspaces.

Follow these steps to set up the development environment on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/TuwaIO/nova-uikit.git](https://github.com/TuwaIO/nova-uikit.git)
cd nova-uikit
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
This project uses `pnpm`. Make sure you have it installed (`npm install -g pnpm`). Then run:

## üíª Development Workflow

The primary way to develop and test components is through Storybook.
